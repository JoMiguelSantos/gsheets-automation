# Lil Projects

This was a small project I did at work (non functional since it doesn't include the actual references) to automate a Google Sheets daily task that consisted in copying all the daily entries coming from a form and create a new tab of all those daily entries, identified by the respective day as tab name and then clearing the main tab where the next day's entries would show up. I used Google Sheets API to perform all operations.
