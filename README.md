# Google Sheets Automation

This was a small project I did at work (non functional since it doesn't include the actual references) to automate a Google Sheets daily task that consisted in copying all the daily entries coming from a form and create a new tab of all those daily entries, identified by the respective day as tab name and then clearing the main tab where the next day's entries would show up. Then the process was changed to have the daily entries appended every day to the respective month sheet, which is what is reflected on the code. I used Google Sheets API to perform all operations.
